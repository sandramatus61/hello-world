# hello-world
Just the begining
Hi coders out there
I'm Sandra,an immigrant middle age woman that, came to Canada from Chile as a teenager by accident.  
I like learning about almost anything and everything.  The act of learning excites me.
I like helping people that for one reason or another share their problems with me,with a kind word,gesture or telling a joke it makes me feel happy.
I love creating new things. When it comes to cooking, I love to try changing recipes around and coming out with totally new recipes.
